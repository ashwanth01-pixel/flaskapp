# Suggested Fixes

Based on the repository context provided, I can suggest several improvements for best practices and scalability:

1. Deployment (deployment.yaml):
   - The file contains multiple duplicate resource specifications. Remove redundant entries and keep only one set of resource limits and requests.
   - Implement the rolling update strategy that's been suggested multiple times but not actually added to the spec:
     ```yaml
     spec:
       strategy:
         type: RollingUpdate
         rollingUpdate:
           maxSurge: 1
           maxUnavailable: 0
     ```

2. Pipeline (pipeline.yml):
   - Remove duplicate linting and testing steps. Keep only one set of flake8 and pytest steps.
   - Implement the suggested Git SHA tagging for Docker images:
     ```yaml
     tags: |
       ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:latest
       ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:${{ github.sha }}
     ```
   - Consider adding a step for security scanning of the Docker image before pushing.

3. Requirements (requirements.txt):
   - The Flask version has been pinned correctly. Consider adding version pins for other dependencies if there are any.
   - Add a comment with the command to generate a full requirements file: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

4. Application (app.py):
   - The debug mode is correctly set to False for production. This is good practice.
   - Consider adding more robust error handling and logging.
   - Implement health check endpoints for Kubernetes probes.

5. Service (service.yaml):
   - Consider using a LoadBalancer or Ingress instead of NodePort for better scalability in a production environment.

6. General:
   - Implement a proper branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow) if not already in use.
   - Add comprehensive unit and integration tests.
   - Consider implementing monitoring and observability tools.
   - Use environment variables for configuration to make the application more portable across different environments.

These improvements will enhance the scalability, maintainability, and reliability of the application in a Kubernetes environment.
