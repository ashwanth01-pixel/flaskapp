# Suggested Fixes

Based on the repository context provided, I can suggest several improvements for best practices and scalability:

1. Deployment Configuration (deployment.yaml):
   - The file has multiple duplicate resource limit definitions. Clean up and keep only one set of resource limits and requests for the container.
   - Implement a rolling update strategy as suggested in the comments: 
     ```yaml
     strategy:
       type: RollingUpdate
       rollingUpdate:
         maxSurge: 1
         maxUnavailable: 0
     ```
   - The readiness and liveness probes are good practices already implemented.

2. CI/CD Pipeline (pipeline.yml):
   - Implement the linting and unit testing steps that are commented out:
     ```yaml
     - name: Lint with flake8
       run: flake8 .
     - name: Run unit tests
       run: pytest
     ```
   - Use Git SHA for Docker image tags as suggested:
     ```yaml
     tags: 
       - ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:latest
       - ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:${{ github.sha }}
     ```

3. Dependencies (requirements.txt):
   - The Flask version is correctly pinned to a specific version (2.3.2), which is a good practice.
   - Consider adding other dependencies your application might need and pin their versions as well.

4. Application Code (app.py):
   - The debug mode is correctly set to False for production, which is a good security practice.
   - Consider adding more robust error handling and logging throughout the application.

5. Service Configuration (service.yaml):
   - The NodePort service type is fine for development, but for production, consider using a LoadBalancer or Ingress for better scalability and security.

6. General Scalability Improvements:
   - Implement horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) to automatically adjust the number of pod replicas based on CPU or custom metrics.
   - Consider using a database for persistence if your application requires it, and ensure it's properly configured for high availability.
   - Implement proper monitoring and alerting for your application and infrastructure.

These improvements will enhance the application's reliability, security, and scalability in a Kubernetes environment.
