# Suggested Fixes

Based on the provided repository context, I can suggest several improvements for best practices and scalability:

1. Deployment (deployment.yaml):
   - The file has multiple duplicate resource definitions. Remove the redundant `resources` blocks and keep only one set of resource limits and requests per container.
   - Implement the rolling update strategy that has been suggested multiple times in the comments. Add:
     ```yaml
     strategy:
       type: RollingUpdate
       rollingUpdate:
         maxSurge: 1
         maxUnavailable: 0
     ```

2. Pipeline (pipeline.yml):
   - Remove duplicate linting and testing steps. Keep only one instance of each:
     ```yaml
     - name: Lint with flake8
       run: flake8 .
     - name: Run unit tests
       run: pytest
     ```
   - Implement the suggested Git SHA tagging for Docker images:
     ```yaml
     tags: |
       ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:latest
       ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:${{ github.sha }}
     ```

3. Requirements (requirements.txt):
   - The file correctly pins the Flask version to 2.3.2. Ensure all other dependencies are also pinned to specific versions for consistency.

4. Application (app.py):
   - The debug mode is correctly set to False for production. However, consider using an environment variable to control debug mode:
     ```python
     debug = os.environ.get('FLASK_DEBUG', 'False').lower() == 'true'
     app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=debug)
     ```

5. General Scalability Improvements:
   - Consider implementing horizontal pod autoscaling in the Kubernetes deployment.
   - Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application.
   - Consider adding health checks and readiness probes to the Kubernetes deployment for better reliability.

These improvements will enhance the project's adherence to best practices and improve its scalability potential.
