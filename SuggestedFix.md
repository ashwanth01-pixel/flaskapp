Based on the repository context provided, here are some suggested improvements for best practices and scalability:

1. Testing: Add a `tests/` directory with unit and integration tests. This is crucial for code reliability and maintaining the CI/CD pipeline. [Source: SuggestedFix.md]

2. Environment Variables: Use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys or database credentials, instead of hardcoding them. Add a `.env.example` file to show which variables are needed. [Source: SuggestedFix.md]

3. Logging: Implement a logging configuration file for proper logging throughout the application. This will aid in debugging and monitoring in production. [Source: SuggestedFix.md]

4. Documentation: Expand documentation by adding:
   - CONTRIBUTING.md for potential contributors
   - API.md or ENDPOINTS.md to document available endpoints
   - DEPLOYMENT.md with deployment instructions
[Source: SuggestedFix.md]

5. Dependency Management: Consider using `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` (for pipenv) or `poetry.lock` (for poetry) in addition to `requirements.txt` for more deterministic dependency management. [Source: SuggestedFix.md]

6. Kubernetes: Ensure Kubernetes manifests follow best practices for resource limits, health checks, and security contexts. The `deployment.yaml` file already includes resource limits and readiness/liveness probes, which is good. [Source: deployment.yaml]

7. CI/CD: Review the GitHub Actions workflow to ensure it includes steps for testing and security scanning. The `pipeline.yml` file already includes steps for linting and unit tests, which is a good practice. [Source: pipeline.yml]

8. Docker Image Tagging: Use Git SHA for Docker image tags to improve versioning. This has been implemented in the `pipeline.yml` file. [Source: pipeline.yml]

9. FAISS Index Management: Implement a process for updating and managing FAISS index files. Consider versioning these files if they change frequently. [Source: SuggestedFix.md]

10. Dependency Versions: In the `requirements.txt` file, the Flask version is correctly pinned to a specific version (2.3.2). Ensure all other dependencies are similarly pinned to specific versions for consistency across environments. [Source: requirements.txt]

These improvements will enhance the project's maintainability, scalability, and adherence to best practices.
