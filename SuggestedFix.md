Based on the repository context, here are some suggested improvements for best practices and scalability:

1. Testing: Add a `tests/` directory with unit and integration tests. This is crucial for code reliability and maintaining the CI/CD pipeline. [Source: SuggestedFix.md]

2. Environment Variables: Use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys or database credentials, instead of hardcoding them. Add a `.env.example` file to show which variables are needed. [Source: SuggestedFix.md]

3. Logging: Implement a logging configuration file for proper logging throughout the application. This will aid in debugging and monitoring in production. [Source: SuggestedFix.md]

4. Documentation: Expand documentation by adding:
   - CONTRIBUTING.md for potential contributors
   - API.md or ENDPOINTS.md to document available endpoints
   - DEPLOYMENT.md with deployment instructions
[Source: SuggestedFix.md]

5. Dependency Management: Consider using `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` (for pipenv) or `poetry.lock` (for poetry) in addition to `requirements.txt` for more deterministic dependency management. [Source: SuggestedFix.md]

6. Kubernetes: The `deployment.yaml` file already includes resource limits and readiness/liveness probes, which is good. Ensure other Kubernetes manifests follow similar best practices. [Source: deployment.yaml]

7. CI/CD: The `pipeline.yml` file includes steps for linting and unit tests, which is a good practice. Consider adding security scanning steps. [Source: pipeline.yml]

8. Docker Image Tagging: The use of Git SHA for Docker image tags in `pipeline.yml` is a good practice for versioning. [Source: pipeline.yml]

9. FAISS Index Management: Implement a process for updating and managing FAISS index files. Consider versioning these files if they change frequently. [Source: SuggestedFix.md]

10. Dependency Versions: In the `requirements.txt` file, ensure all dependencies are pinned to specific versions for consistency across environments, similar to how Flask is pinned to version 2.3.2. [Source: requirements.txt]

These improvements will enhance the project's maintainability, scalability, and adherence to best practices.
