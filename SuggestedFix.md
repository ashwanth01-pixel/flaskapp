# Suggested Fixes & Improvements

Based on the repository context provided:

1. Docker image tagging:
The pipeline.yml file repeatedly mentions using Git SHA for Docker image tags. This is a good practice for versioning and traceability. For example:
"Use Git SHA for Docker image tags, e.g., tags: ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:latest,ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:${{ github.sha }}"
(Source: pipeline.yml)

2. Unit testing:
The pipeline.yml file suggests adding a step to run unit tests before building and pushing the Docker image. This is a good practice to ensure code quality before deployment.
(Source: pipeline.yml)

3. Linting:
There's a suggestion to add steps for linting (e.g., flake8) before building the Docker image. This helps maintain code quality and consistency.

4. Secrets management:
The pipeline.yml file recommends using GitHub Secrets for sensitive information like Docker Hub credentials. This is crucial for security.

5. Self-hosted runner:
The pipeline is set to run on a self-hosted runner. This can be good for performance and control, but ensure it's properly secured.
(Source: pipeline.yml)

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Implement the suggested linting step in the pipeline.
2. Ensure unit tests are actually implemented and run in the pipeline.
3. Use GitHub Secrets for all sensitive information, not just Docker Hub credentials.
4. Consider adding vulnerability scanning for the Docker image.
5. Implement proper error handling and notifications in the pipeline.
6. Consider adding a staging environment for testing before production deployment.

Note that without access to the actual content of the files, these suggestions are based on the limited context provided in the pipeline.yml file comments.
