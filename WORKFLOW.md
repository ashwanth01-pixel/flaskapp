Here's a detailed developer guide for this repository based on the provided context:

1. Project Overview:
   This is a Flask-based web application deployed on Kubernetes with CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions. The application likely incorporates FAISS for vector search capabilities. [README.md]

2. Development Environment Setup:
   - Use Python 3.x (specific version not provided)
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Flask 2.3.2 is the main web framework [requirements.txt]

3. Project Structure:
   - Root directory: Contains main application files (app.py, Dockerfile, requirements.txt)
   - .github/workflows: CI/CD pipeline configuration (pipeline.yml)
   - k8s: Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml)
   - faiss_index: FAISS index files for vector search (index.faiss, index.pkl)
   [WORKFLOW.md]

4. Application Code:
   - Main application logic is in app.py
   - FAISS index is used for vector search (faiss_index directory)
   [WORKFLOW.md]

5. Testing:
   - Add a `tests/` directory with unit and integration tests
   - Run tests using pytest: `pytest`
   - Linting is done with flake8: `flake8 .`
   [SuggestedFix.md, pipeline.yml]

6. Docker:
   - Dockerfile is present in the root directory
   - Build image: `docker build -t ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:latest .`
   - Run container: `docker run -p 5000:5000 ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:latest`
   [WORKFLOW.md]

7. Kubernetes Deployment:
   - Kubernetes manifests are in the k8s directory
   - Deploy: 
     ```
     kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
     kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
     ```
   - The deployment uses a rolling update strategy and includes resource limits and health checks
   [WORKFLOW.md, SuggestedFix.md]

8. CI/CD:
   - GitHub Actions workflow is defined in .github/workflows/pipeline.yml
   - The pipeline includes steps for linting, testing, building Docker image, and deploying to Kubernetes
   - Docker Hub is used for image registry
   - Images are tagged with both 'latest' and the Git SHA
   [pipeline.yml, WORKFLOW.md]

9. Environment Variables:
   - Use environment variables for sensitive information
   - Add a `.env.example` file to show which variables are needed
   - FLASK_ENV and PYTHONUNBUFFERED are set in the Kubernetes deployment
   [SuggestedFix.md, WORKFLOW.md]

10. Logging:
    - Implement a logging configuration file for proper logging throughout the application
    [SuggestedFix.md]

11. Documentation:
    - Expand documentation by adding:
      - CONTRIBUTING.md for potential contributors
      - API.md or ENDPOINTS.md to document available endpoints
      - DEPLOYMENT.md with deployment instructions
    [SuggestedFix.md]

12. Dependency Management:
    - Consider using `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` (for pipenv) or `poetry.lock` (for poetry) in addition to `requirements.txt`
    [SuggestedFix.md]

13. Security:
    - Use environment variables for sensitive information
    - Implement a .dockerignore file
    - Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information in CI/CD
    [SuggestedFix.md, WORKFLOW.md]

14. FAISS Index Management:
    - Implement a process for updating and managing FAISS index files
    - Consider versioning these files if they change frequently
    [SuggestedFix.md]

15. Best Practices:
    - Follow Python style guidelines (implied by use of flake8 in pipeline)
    - Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt are pinned to specific versions
    - Review Kubernetes manifests for best practices in resource limits, health checks, and security contexts
    [SuggestedFix.md, WORKFLOW.md]
