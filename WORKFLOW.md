Here's a detailed developer guide for this repository based on the provided context:

1. Project Structure:
   The repository has a typical structure for a Flask application with Kubernetes deployment (SuggestedFix.md, Design.md). Key components include:
   - Root directory: Contains main application files (app.py, Dockerfile, requirements.txt)
   - .github/workflows: CI/CD pipeline configuration (pipeline.yml)
   - k8s: Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml)
   - faiss_index: FAISS index files for vector search (index.faiss, index.pkl)

2. Development Environment:
   - Use Python 3.x (specific version not provided in context)
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Flask is the main web framework (requirements.txt)

3. Application Code:
   - Main application logic is in app.py (mentioned in Design.md)
   - FAISS index is used for vector search (faiss_index directory)

4. Testing:
   - No dedicated test directory exists, but it's recommended to add one (SuggestedFix.md)
   - The CI/CD pipeline includes steps for linting with flake8 and running pytest (pipeline.yml)

5. Docker:
   - Dockerfile is present in the root directory (Design.md)
   - Build image: `docker build -t ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:latest .`
   - Run container: `docker run -p 5000:5000 ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:latest`

6. Kubernetes Deployment:
   - Kubernetes manifests are in the k8s directory (deployment.yaml, service.yaml)
   - Deploy: 
     ```
     kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
     kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
     ```
   - The deployment uses a rolling update strategy and includes resource limits and health checks (deployment.yaml)

7. CI/CD:
   - GitHub Actions workflow is defined in .github/workflows/pipeline.yml
   - The pipeline includes steps for linting, testing, building Docker image, and deploying to Kubernetes
   - Docker Hub is used for image registry (pipeline.yml)

8. Environment Variables:
   - FLASK_ENV and PYTHONUNBUFFERED are set in the Kubernetes deployment (deployment.yaml)
   - It's recommended to use a .env file for local development (SuggestedFix.md)

9. Logging:
   - No specific logging configuration is mentioned, but it's recommended to add one (SuggestedFix.md)

10. Security:
    - Use environment variables for sensitive information (SuggestedFix.md)
    - Implement a .dockerignore file (SuggestedFix.md)
    - Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information in CI/CD (pipeline.yml)

11. Contributing:
    - No CONTRIBUTING.md file exists, but it's recommended to add one (SuggestedFix.md)
    - Follow Python style guidelines (implied by use of flake8 in pipeline.yml)

12. Deployment:
    - The application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster
    - The service is exposed on NodePort 30080 (pipeline.yml)

13. Versioning:
    - Docker images are tagged with both 'latest' and the Git SHA (pipeline.yml)

This guide provides an overview based on the available context. For more detailed information, developers should refer to the specific files mentioned and any additional documentation that may exist in the repository.
