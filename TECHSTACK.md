2. Flask: A Python web framework used for the backend application, specified in requirements.txt and used in app.py.

3. Docker: Used for containerization, as seen in the Docker-related steps in pipeline.yml.

4. Kubernetes: Used for container orchestration and deployment, as shown in deployment.yaml and service.yaml files.

5. GitHub Actions: The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions, as seen in the pipeline.yml file.

6. flake8: A linting tool for Python, used in the pipeline (pipeline.yml).

7. pytest: A testing framework for Python, used in the pipeline (pipeline.yml).

8. kubectl: The Kubernetes command-line tool, used in the pipeline for applying manifests and verifying deployments (pipeline.yml).

These technologies form the core of the application's development, testing, containerization, and deployment processes.
