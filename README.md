This repository seems to be a well-structured backend application that leverages modern development practices such as containerization, orchestration, and CI/CD. The use of FAISS suggests that the application deals with vector similarity searches, which could be used for recommendations, search functionality, or other AI/ML-related features. The presence of Kubernetes configurations indicates that the application is designed to be deployed in a scalable, cloud-native environment.

**Tech Stack:**
Based on the repository structure and files provided, I can infer the following main tech stack:

1. Language: Python (indicated by app.py and requirements.txt)

2. Web Framework: Not explicitly shown, but likely Flask or FastAPI (common Python web frameworks)

3. Docker: Used for containerization (Dockerfile present)

4. Kubernetes: For container orchestration (k8s folder with deployment.yaml and service.yaml)

5. FAISS: For similarity search and clustering of dense vectors (faiss_index folder)

6. GitHub Actions: For CI/CD pipeline (.github/workflows/pipeline.yml)

7. Git: For version control

8. Requirements management: pip (requirements.txt file)

No specific database is mentioned in the given structure, so I can't confirm if or what database is being used.

This appears to be a Python-based application using containerization and Kubernetes for deployment, with FAISS for some kind of vector search functionality. The CI/CD pipeline is handled through GitHub Actions.

**Working Flow:**
Certainly! I'll provide a detailed developer guide based on the repository structure you've shared. Please note that this guide is an inference based on the available information, and some details may need to be adjusted based on the actual implementation.

# Developer Guide for AshApp Backend

## Project Overview

This project appears to be a backend application, likely a REST API, built with Python. It uses FAISS for vector similarity search and is containerized using Docker. The application is deployed to Kubernetes and uses a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

## System Components

1. Backend API (app.py)
2. FAISS Index (faiss_index/)
3. Docker container
4. Kubernetes deployment
5. CI/CD pipeline

## Setup and Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application locally:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Backend (app.py)

The `app.py` file is the main entry point for the application. It likely contains:

- Flask or FastAPI setup
- API route definitions
- Integration with the FAISS index for similarity search
- Any necessary data processing or business logic

Key aspects to look for in `app.py`:
- API endpoints and their functionality
- Error handling and logging
- Integration with external services or databases (if any)

## FAISS Index

The FAISS index is stored in the `faiss_index/` directory:

- `index.faiss`: The binary FAISS index file
- `index.pkl`: A pickled file, likely containing metadata or mappings for the index

The application probably loads these files on startup to perform fast similarity searches.

## Docker Configuration

The `Dockerfile` defines how the application is containerized. Key points:

- Base image selection (probably a Python image)
- Copying application files
- Installing dependencies
- Setting up the FAISS index
- Defining the command to run the application

## Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes configurations are in the `k8s/` directory:

- `deployment.yaml`: Defines how the application is deployed, including:
  - Number of replicas
  - Container image and tag
  - Environment variables
  - Resource requests and limits
- `service.yaml`: Defines how the application is exposed within the cluster or externally

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`. It likely includes:

1. Checkout the code
2. Set up Python environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Run linting and unit tests
5. Build and push Docker image
6. Deploy to Kubernetes

The pipeline uses GitHub Actions and runs on self-hosted runners.

## API Routes

While we don't have the exact implementation, typical routes for this kind of application might include:

- `POST /search`: Perform a similarity search using the FAISS index
- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint
- `POST /update_index`: Endpoint to update the FAISS index (if implemented)

## Deployment Process

1. Changes are pushed to the main branch
2. GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
3. Tests are run, and the Docker image is built and pushed
4. The new image is deployed to Kubernetes
5. Kubernetes rolls out the update to the pods

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
2. Make changes and test locally
3. Commit changes and push to GitHub
4. Create a Pull Request for review
5. After approval, merge to main branch
6. CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the changes

## Configuration and Environment Variables

Check the `Dockerfile`, `k8s/deployment.yaml`, and `app.py` for any environment variables or configuration settings that need to be set.

## Monitoring and Logging

Implement logging in `app.py` and consider setting up monitoring for the Kubernetes deployment.

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Implement database integration if required
- Set up staging environment for testing before production deployment
- Implement automated rollback in case of deployment failures
