## System Components

1. Backend API (app.py)
2. FAISS Index (faiss_index/)
3. Docker container
4. Kubernetes deployment
5. CI/CD pipeline

## Setup and Local Development

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application locally:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Backend (app.py)

The `app.py` file is the main entry point for the application. It likely contains:

- Flask or FastAPI setup
- API route definitions
- Integration with the FAISS index for similarity search
- Any necessary data processing or business logic

Key aspects to look for in `app.py`:
- API endpoints and their functionality
- Error handling and logging
- Integration with external services or databases (if any)

## FAISS Index

The FAISS index is stored in the `faiss_index/` directory:

- `index.faiss`: The binary FAISS index file
- `index.pkl`: A pickled file, likely containing metadata or mappings for the index

The application probably loads these files on startup to perform fast similarity searches.

## Docker Configuration

The `Dockerfile` defines how the application is containerized. Key points:

- Base image selection (probably a Python image)
- Copying application files
- Installing dependencies
- Setting up the FAISS index
- Defining the command to run the application

## Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes configurations are in the `k8s/` directory:

- `deployment.yaml`: Defines how the application is deployed, including:
  - Number of replicas
  - Container image and tag
  - Environment variables
  - Resource requests and limits
- `service.yaml`: Defines how the application is exposed within the cluster or externally

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`. It likely includes:

1. Checkout the code
2. Set up Python environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Run linting and unit tests
5. Build and push Docker image
6. Deploy to Kubernetes

The pipeline uses GitHub Actions and runs on self-hosted runners.

## API Routes

While we don't have the exact implementation, typical routes for this kind of application might include:

- `POST /search`: Perform a similarity search using the FAISS index
- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint
- `POST /update_index`: Endpoint to update the FAISS index (if implemented)

## Deployment Process

1. Changes are pushed to the main branch
2. GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
3. Tests are run, and the Docker image is built and pushed
4. The new image is deployed to Kubernetes
5. Kubernetes rolls out the update to the pods

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
2. Make changes and test locally
3. Commit changes and push to GitHub
4. Create a Pull Request for review
5. After approval, merge to main branch
6. CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the changes

## Configuration and Environment Variables

Check the `Dockerfile`, `k8s/deployment.yaml`, and `app.py` for any environment variables or configuration settings that need to be set.

## Monitoring and Logging

Implement logging in `app.py` and consider setting up monitoring for the Kubernetes deployment.

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Implement database integration if required
- Set up staging environment for testing before production deployment
- Implement automated rollback in case of deployment failures

This guide provides a high-level overview of the project structure and development process. Developers should refer to specific files for more detailed information and consult
