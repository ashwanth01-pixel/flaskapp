## üîç Repository Analysis
**Summary:**
Based on the repository context provided:

This appears to be a Python-based application with a CI/CD pipeline set up using GitHub Actions. The main components and purpose can be summarized as follows:

1. Application:
   - The core application code is likely contained in app.py, though we don't have its contents.
   - There's a requirements.txt file, suggesting it's a Python project with dependencies.
   - A Dockerfile is present, indicating the application can be containerized.

2. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - The pipeline is defined in .github/workflows/pipeline.yml.
   - It uses self-hosted runners (runs-on: self-hosted).
   - The pipeline includes steps for:
     a. Running unit tests before building the Docker image.
     b. Building and pushing a Docker image to Docker Hub.
     c. Using Git SHA for Docker image tagging (e.g., ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:${{ github.sha }}).
   - It recommends using GitHub Secrets for sensitive information like Docker Hub credentials.

3. Kubernetes Deployment:
   - The k8s/ directory contains deployment.yaml and service.yaml files, suggesting the application is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

4. FAISS Index:
   - The faiss_index/ directory with index.pkl and index.faiss files suggests the application might be using Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

5. Version Control:
   - The repository uses Git for version control, as evidenced by the .git/ directory and .gitignore file.

The purpose of this repository appears to be a backend application (possibly named "ashapp-backend") that uses FAISS for some form of vector similarity search or machine learning task. It's set up with a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment to a Kubernetes environment.

This summary is based on the file structure provided and the contents of the pipeline.yml file. Without access to the actual code in app.py or other files, it's difficult to provide more specific details about the application's functionality.

**Tech Stack:**
Based on the repository structure provided, I can infer the following about the main tech stack:

1. Python: The presence of app.py and requirements.txt suggests that this is a Python-based project.

2. Docker: The Dockerfile indicates that the application is containerized using Docker.

3. Kubernetes: The k8s folder containing deployment.yaml and service.yaml files suggests that the application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.

4. FAISS: The faiss_index folder with index.pkl and index.faiss files indicates the use of Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) library, likely for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

5. GitHub Actions: The .github/workflows/pipeline.yml file suggests that the project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.

6. Git: The presence of the .git folder and its contents confirms that the project uses Git for version control.

It's important to note that while these technologies can be inferred from the repository structure, the actual code and configuration files are not provided in the context, so the specific frameworks, databases, and other tools used within the application cannot be determined with certainty.

This information is derived from the repository structure provided in the question.

**Working Flow:**
Based on the repository provided:

The project structure indicates this is likely a backend application with a CI/CD pipeline and Kubernetes deployment. However, there's limited information available to provide a comprehensive developer guide. I'll outline what can be inferred from the given structure:

1. Backend Application:
   - The main application code is likely in `app.py`.
   - Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
   - The application is containerized using Docker, as evidenced by the `Dockerfile`.

2. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD, with the pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`.
   - Based on the comments in `pipeline.yml`, the pipeline includes:
     - Running unit tests
     - Linting (e.g., using flake8)
     - Building and pushing a Docker image
     - Using Git SHA for Docker image tags
   - Sensitive information like Docker Hub credentials are stored as GitHub Secrets.

3. Deployment:
   - The application is deployed to Kubernetes, as indicated by the `k8s/deployment.yaml` and `k8s/service.yaml` files.
   - The pipeline likely includes steps to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster after building the Docker image.

4. FAISS Index:
   - The presence of `faiss_index/index.pkl` and `faiss_index/index.faiss` suggests the application uses FAISS for similarity search or nearest neighbor queries.

5. Development Workflow:
   1. Developers would work on the application code in `app.py`.
   2. Dependencies should be updated in `requirements.txt`.
   3. Any changes to the Docker build process would be made in `Dockerfile`.
   4. CI/CD pipeline modifications would be done in `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`.
   5. Kubernetes deployment changes would be made in the `k8s/` directory.

6. Running the Application:
   - Locally: Developers likely use `python app.py` or a similar command to run the application.
   - In production: The application runs as a container in a Kubernetes cluster.

Note that this guide is limited by the available information. A more detailed guide would require access to the actual code and configuration files, which are not provided in the given context.
