# Developer Guide for AshApp Backend

## Project Overview

This project appears to be a backend application, likely a REST API, built with Python. It uses FAISS for vector similarity search and is containerized using Docker. The application is deployed to Kubernetes and uses a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

## System Components

1. Backend API (app.py)
2. FAISS Index (faiss_index/)
3. Docker container
4. Kubernetes deployment
5. CI/CD pipeline

## Setup and Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application locally:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Backend (app.py)

The `app.py` file is the main entry point for the application. It likely contains:

- Flask or FastAPI setup
- API route definitions
- Integration with the FAISS index for similarity search
- Any necessary data processing or business logic

Key aspects to look for in `app.py`:
- API endpoints and their functionality
- Error handling and logging
- Integration with external services or databases (if any)

## FAISS Index

The FAISS index is stored in the `faiss_index/` directory:

- `index.faiss`: The binary FAISS index file
- `index.pkl`: A pickled file, likely containing metadata or mappings for the index

The application probably loads these files on startup to perform fast similarity searches.

## Docker Configuration

The `Dockerfile` defines how the application is containerized. Key points:

- Base image selection (probably a Python image)
- Copying application files
- Installing dependencies
- Setting up the FAISS index
- Defining the command to run the application

## Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes configurations are in the `k8s/` directory:

- `deployment.yaml`: Defines how the application is deployed, including:
  - Number of replicas
  - Container image and tag
  - Environment variables
  - Resource requests and limits
- `service.yaml`: Defines how the application is exposed within the cluster or externally

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`. It likely includes:

1. Checkout the code
2. Set up Python environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Run linting and unit tests
5. Build and push Docker image
6. Deploy to Kubernetes

The pipeline uses GitHub Actions and runs on self-hosted runners.

## API Routes

While we don't have the exact implementation, typical routes for this kind of application might include:

- `POST /search`: Perform a similarity search using the FAISS index
- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint
- `POST /update_index`: Endpoint to update the FAISS index (if implemented)

## Deployment Process

1. Changes are pushed to the main branch
2. GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
3. Tests are run, and the Docker image is built and pushed
4. The new image is deployed to Kubernetes
5. Kubernetes rolls out the update to the pods

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
2. Make changes and test locally
3. Commit changes and push to GitHub
4. Create a Pull Request for review
5. After approval, merge to main branch
6. CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the changes

## Configuration and Environment Variables

Check the `Dockerfile`, `k8s/deployment.yaml`, and `app.py` for any environment variables or configuration settings that need to be set.

## Monitoring and Logging

Implement logging in `app.py` and consider setting up monitoring for the Kubernetes deployment.

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Implement database integration if required
- Set up staging environment for testing before production deployment
- Implement automated rollback in case of deployment failures

# Developer Guide for Ash App

## Project Overview

This project appears to be a backend application, likely using Python, with a FastAPI or Flask-based API. It uses FAISS for vector similarity search and is containerized using Docker. The application is deployed on Kubernetes and uses a GitHub Actions pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.

## System Components

1. Backend API (app.py)
2. FAISS Index for vector search
3. Docker container
4. Kubernetes deployment
5. CI/CD pipeline

## Startup Process

1. The application starts by running the `app.py` file.
2. It loads the FAISS index from the `faiss_index` directory.
3. The API server starts and listens for incoming requests.

## Backend

The backend is implemented in `app.py`. It likely uses FastAPI or Flask to create API endpoints. The main functionalities include:

1. Loading the FAISS index from `faiss_index/index.faiss` and `faiss_index/index.pkl`.
2. Defining API routes for various operations (e.g., search, add, delete).
3. Handling requests and performing vector similarity searches using the FAISS index.

Key files:
- `app.py`: Main application file
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `faiss_index/index.faiss`: FAISS index file
- `faiss_index/index.pkl`: Pickled data associated with the FAISS index

## Database

This project doesn't seem to use a traditional database. Instead, it uses FAISS for vector similarity search. The FAISS index is stored in the `faiss_index` directory:

- `faiss_index/index.faiss`: The actual FAISS index
- `faiss_index/index.pkl`: Additional pickled data, possibly metadata or mappings

## APIs

While we don't have the exact API routes, based on typical FAISS applications, the API likely includes endpoints for:

1. Searching similar vectors
2. Adding new vectors to the index
3. Deleting vectors from the index
4. Getting information about the index

These endpoints would be defined in `app.py`.

## Deployment

The application is containerized using Docker and deployed on Kubernetes.

### Docker

1. The `Dockerfile` in the root directory defines how the application is containerized.
2. It likely includes steps to:
   - Set up a Python environment
   - Copy the application files
   - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Set the command to run `app.py`

### Kubernetes

The Kubernetes deployment is defined in the `k8s` directory:

- `k8s/deployment.yaml`: Defines the Kubernetes Deployment, including the number of replicas, container specifications, and resource requirements.
- `k8s/service.yaml`: Defines the Kubernetes Service, which exposes the application within the cluster or externally.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`. It likely includes the following steps:

1. Checkout the code
2. Set up Python environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Run tests (if any)
5. Build the Docker image
6. Push the Docker image to a registry (probably Docker Hub)
7. Deploy to Kubernetes (possibly using `kubectl` or a Kubernetes plugin)

## Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Make changes to the code, primarily in `app.py`
4. Test locally by running `python app.py`
5. Build and test the Docker image locally:
   ```
   docker build -t ashapp-backend .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 ashapp-backend
   ```
6. Commit changes and push to GitHub
7. The GitHub Actions pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the changes

## Configuration

- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files should be ignored by Git
- `config` files in the `.git` directory: Git configuration
- Environment variables may be used for sensitive information, especially in the CI/CD pipeline

## Additional Notes

- `Design.md` likely contains high-level design decisions and architecture information
