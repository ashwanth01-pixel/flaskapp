**Summary:**
Based on the provided context, this repository appears to be for a backend application that has undergone several improvements and fixes. Here's a detailed summary:

1. Application (app.py):
   - The application is likely a Flask-based backend service.
   - A fix was applied to ensure debug mode is disabled in production, either by setting debug=False or using an environment variable.

2. Kubernetes Deployment (k8s/deployment.yaml):
   - The application is deployed using Kubernetes.
   - Resource limits and requests were added to the container spec to ensure proper resource allocation and prevent resource exhaustion.
   - Readiness and liveness probes were added to ensure proper health checking of the application.

3. CI/CD Pipeline (.github/workflows/pipeline.yml):
   - The repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
   - Several improvements were made to the pipeline:
     a. Docker image tagging now includes both 'latest' and the Git SHA for better versioning.
     b. Unit tests were added to run before building and pushing the Docker image.
     c. Linting (e.g., flake8) was added to improve code quality.
     d. GitHub Secrets are now used for sensitive information like Docker Hub credentials.
     e. Duplicate definitions of linting and testing steps were removed, and these steps were properly added before the Docker build step.
     f. Dependencies are now properly installed for linting and testing.

4. Docker:
   - The application is containerized using Docker.
   - The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub under the repository ashwanth01/ashapp-backend.

5. Security:
   - Efforts were made to improve security by using GitHub Secrets for sensitive information.
   - Disabling debug mode in production helps prevent potential security risks.

6. Code Quality:
   - The addition of linting suggests a focus on maintaining code quality and consistency.

7. Testing:
   - Unit tests were added to the CI/CD pipeline, indicating a commitment to code reliability and quality assurance.

8. Resource Management:
   - The addition of resource limits and requests in the Kubernetes deployment shows attention to proper resource allocation and system stability.
