# Repository Summary

Based on the provided repository context, especially the app.py file, this appears to be a simple Flask-based backend application intended to run on Kubernetes. Here's a summary of the repository's purpose and main components:

1. Purpose:
   The repository contains a basic Flask web application that serves as a backend service, likely part of a larger system or microservices architecture.

2. Main components:

   a. Flask Application (app.py):
   - Creates a Flask app with a single route ("/")
   - Implements basic logging
   - Configures the app to run on host 0.0.0.0 and port 5000
   - Ensures debug mode is disabled for production use

   b. Kubernetes Deployment (deployment.yaml):
   - Defines how the application should be deployed on Kubernetes
   - Specifies container image, resource limits, and health checks

   c. Kubernetes Service (service.yaml):
   - Exposes the application as a NodePort service on port 30080

   d. CI/CD Pipeline (pipeline.yml):
   - Defines the build and deployment process
   - Includes steps for linting, testing, building a Docker image, and deploying to Kubernetes

   e. Dependencies (requirements.txt):
   - Lists the Python dependencies, specifically Flask version 2.3.2

The repository is set up to deploy a simple "Hello World" style Flask application to a Kubernetes cluster, with considerations for production readiness such as disabling debug mode, implementing health checks, and using a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

## Tech Stack
Based on the repository context provided, the main tech stack includes:

1. Python: The backend is written in Python, as evidenced by the Flask application in app.py.

2. Flask: A Python web framework used for the backend application (app.py, requirements.txt).

3. Docker: Used for containerization, as seen in the Docker image build and push steps in pipeline.yml.

4. Kubernetes: Used for orchestration and deployment, as shown in deployment.yaml and service.yaml files.

5. GitHub Actions: The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions, as seen in the pipeline.yml file.

6. flake8: A linting tool used in the pipeline for code quality checks (pipeline.yml).

7. pytest: A testing framework used for running unit tests in the pipeline (pipeline.yml).

These technologies form the core of the application's development, deployment, and infrastructure stack.

## Workflow
Here's a detailed developer guide for this repository:

1. Project Overview:
This repository contains a Flask-based backend application designed to run on Kubernetes. The main application is defined in `app.py`, with deployment configurations in `deployment.yaml` and a CI/CD pipeline in `pipeline.yml`.

2. Setting Up the Environment:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed.
   - Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - The `requirements.txt` file specifies Flask version 2.3.2 (requirements.txt).

3. Application Structure:
   - `app.py`: Contains the main Flask application.
   - It defines a single route ("/") that returns a greeting message.
   - Logging is configured to INFO level (app.py).

4. Running the Application Locally:
   - Execute `python app.py` to run the application.
   - The app will run on `0.0.0.0:5000`.
   - Debug mode is set to False for production safety (app.py).

5. Docker Configuration:
   - The `Dockerfile` uses python:3.9-slim as the base image.
   - It copies the application files and installs dependencies.
   - The container exposes port 5000.
   - The application is started using `CMD ["python", "-u", "app.py"]` (Dockerfile).

6. Kubernetes Deployment:
   - The `deployment.yaml` file defines the Kubernetes deployment.
   - It specifies 2 replicas of the application.
   - Resource limits and requests are set for proper resource allocation.
   - Readiness and liveness probes are configured for health checking.
   - A rolling update strategy is implemented for smooth updates (deployment.yaml).

7. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - The pipeline is defined in `pipeline.yml`.
   - It runs on self-hosted runners.
   - Steps include:
     - Code linting with flake8
     - Running unit tests with pytest
     - Building and pushing a Docker image to Docker Hub
     - Applying Kubernetes manifests
     - Verifying the deployment
     - Testing the application
   - The pipeline uses GitHub Secrets for Docker Hub credentials (pipeline.yml).

8. Best Practices:
   - The Docker image is tagged with both 'latest' and the Git SHA for versioning.
   - Sensitive information is stored in GitHub Secrets.
   - Linting and unit tests are run before building the Docker image.
   - Resource limits and requests are set to prevent resource exhaustion.
   - Rolling update strategy ensures zero-downtime deployments.

9. Deployment Verification:
   - After deployment, the service is accessible via NodePort 30080.
   - The pipeline includes steps to verify the deployment and test the application.

10. Cleanup:
    - In case of deployment failure, the pipeline includes a cleanup step to remove the Kubernetes resources.

This guide provides an overview of the project structure, development setup, deployment process, and best practices implemented in the repository. Developers should pay attention to the commented sections in the files, as they contain important notes and recent updates made by automation bots.
