## üîç Repository Analysis
**Summary:**
I apologize, but I don't have enough context to provide a detailed summary of the repository. The information provided consists mainly of comments and suggested changes, but doesn't give a comprehensive view of the actual contents or structure of the repository.

From the comments, it appears that this repository likely contains:

1. A Dockerfile for building a backend application image
2. Kubernetes deployment configuration files
3. GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD

Some key points that can be inferred:

1. The application is called "ashapp-backend"
2. Docker images are being pushed to Docker Hub under the username "ashwanth01"
3. There have been suggestions to improve the CI/CD process, including:
   - Using Git SHA for Docker image versioning
   - Adding linting and unit testing steps
   - Using GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
4. Kubernetes deployment improvements have been suggested, such as:
   - Adding resource limits and requests
   - Implementing a rolling update strategy
   - Adding readiness and liveness probes

However, without more information about the actual code, architecture, or purpose of the application, I can't provide a more detailed summary of the repository. If you have specific questions about certain aspects of the repository, I'd be happy to try to answer them based on the information available.

**Tech Stack:**
Based on the context provided, I can identify the following main components of the tech stack:

1. Python: The backend appears to be written in Python.

2. Flask: A Python web framework is being used to create the web application.

3. Docker: Docker is mentioned for containerizing the application.

4. Kubernetes: The application is running on Kubernetes, as mentioned in the home route message.

5. GitHub Actions: References to GitHub SHA suggest that GitHub Actions is likely used for CI/CD.

6. Logging: Python's built-in logging module is used for application logging.

That's all I can confidently determine from the given context. There's no explicit mention of databases or other specific tools. If you need more information about other components of the tech stack, I would need additional context.

**Working Flow:**
I apologize, but I don't have enough context about a specific project to explain its working flow like a developer guide. The information provided only contains some isolated comments about Kubernetes deployment configurations, which doesn't give me a complete picture of any particular project.

To provide a meaningful developer guide, I would need more comprehensive information about the project's structure, components, technologies used, and overall architecture. Without this context, I can't accurately describe the workflow or provide a developer guide.

If you have a specific project in mind, it would be helpful if you could provide more details about it, such as its purpose, main components, and any specific areas you'd like explained. Then I could try to assist you better.
