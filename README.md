   - There's a requirements.txt file, suggesting it's a Python project with dependencies.
   - A Dockerfile is present, indicating the application can be containerized.

2. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - The pipeline is defined in .github/workflows/pipeline.yml.
   - It uses self-hosted runners (runs-on: self-hosted).
   - The pipeline includes steps for:
     a. Running unit tests before building the Docker image.
     b. Building and pushing a Docker image to Docker Hub.
     c. Using Git SHA for Docker image tagging (e.g., ashwanth01/ashapp-backend:${{ github.sha }}).
   - It recommends using GitHub Secrets for sensitive information like Docker Hub credentials.

3. Kubernetes Deployment:
   - The k8s/ directory contains deployment.yaml and service.yaml files, suggesting the application is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

4. FAISS Index:
   - The faiss_index/ directory with index.pkl and index.faiss files suggests the application might be using Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

5. Version Control:
   - The repository uses Git for version control, as evidenced by the .git/ directory and .gitignore file.

The purpose of this repository appears to be a backend application (possibly named "ashapp-backend") that uses FAISS for some form of vector similarity search or machine learning task. It's set up with a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment to a Kubernetes environment.
