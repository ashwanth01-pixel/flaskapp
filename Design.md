# Repository Design & Architecture

Below is an automatically generated block diagram of the repo workflow:

Based on the repository structure provided, I can create a Mermaid diagram that represents the likely architecture and workflow of this project. Here's my interpretation:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[GitHub Repository] --> B[GitHub Actions]
    B --> C[CI/CD Pipeline]
    C --> D[Build Docker Image]
    D --> E[Push to Docker Hub]
    E --> F[Deploy to Kubernetes]
    F --> G[Kubernetes Cluster]
    G --> H[Backend Service]
    H --> I[FAISS Index]
    J[Client] --> H
    H --> K[External Services/APIs]

    subgraph "Kubernetes"
    G
    H
    end

    subgraph "Local Development"
    L[app.py]
    M[requirements.txt]
    N[Dockerfile]
    end

    subgraph "CI/CD"
    B
    C
    D
    E
    end
```

This diagram shows:

1. The GitHub repository as the starting point.
2. GitHub Actions triggering the CI/CD pipeline.
3. The pipeline building a Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, and deploying to Kubernetes.
4. A Kubernetes cluster running the backend service.
5. The backend service interacting with a FAISS index (likely for similarity search or recommendation).
6. Clients interacting with the backend service.
7. The backend potentially communicating with external services or APIs.
8. A local development environment with the main application file, requirements, and Dockerfile.

This interpretation is based on the presence of Kubernetes manifests, a Dockerfile, GitHub Actions workflow, and FAISS index files. The actual architecture may vary, but this provides a reasonable approximation based on the available information.
